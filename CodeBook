The run_analysis script performs the data preparation and then answered the 5 questions as stated in the course projectâ€™s instructions.

I used the following variables assigned with related data

features <- features.txt : 561 rows, 2 columns
activities <- activity_labels.txt : 6 rows, 2 columns
subject_test <- test/subject_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 column


Creating the train and the test sets

X_test <- test/X_test.txt : 2947 rows, 561 columns
Y_test <- test/y_test.txt : 2947 rows, 1 columns
Subject_test <-2947 rows,1 column
Subject_train <- test/subject_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 column
X_train <- test/X_train.txt : 7352 rows, 561 columns
Y_train <- test/y_train.txt : 7352 rows, 1 columns

Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

X (10299 rows, 561 columns) by merging X_train and X_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 columns) by merging Y_train and Y_test using rbind() function
Subject (10299 rows, 1 column) by merging Subject_train and Subject_test using rbind() function
allData (10299 rows, 563 column) is created by merging Subject, Y and X using cbind() function



From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

tidy_Data_final (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing TidyData taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after groupped by subject and activity.

Creating FinalData.txt

Export tidy_Data_final into FinalData.txt file.
